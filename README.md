The programme finds an optimal packing configuration for a container with dimensions 33 x 8 x 5 via different methods - simple greedy search, 
backtracking and divide & conquer. There is also a sophisticated maximal layers algorithm which isn't fully implemented.

After choosing the way of packing the container the programme displays the solution using JavaFX 3D.

It was my university group project, which I developed in January 2018.
